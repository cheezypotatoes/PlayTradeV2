# Project PlayTrade V2

## Discord Auto Sender that uses post requests and handles multiple accounts at once

# This project is made 100% in Rust and is used to send messages in multiple servers automatically. It is also very configurable with settings such as using multiple accounts that cycle every server and sending messages at specific intervals and wrapping messages in randomized fonts.
